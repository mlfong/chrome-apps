Chrome App shortcuts

## about

I like(d) the chrome new tab page -- but the Chrome Store lacks some of the links I use, so I made them.

Sept 2013 Google decided to put google.com into the new tab page, which is ridiculous, because the URL bar is already the search bar. So to get rid of that, go to chrome://flags/ then look for "Enable Instant Extended API" and set it to Disabled. Bam, old new tab page.
